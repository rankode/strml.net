[clearing throat..]

Dear Ash,

The happiest of birthdays to you. Just imagine there is a cake appearing right now.

You are such a wonderful human being ! We spend quite a lot of time together,
usually lunching + seeking out coffee someplace. Playing board games. Doing computer stuff. Just chillin'. I feel so priviledged to have you in my life.

You are crazy clever. Fun. Adventurous. Creative. I could continue.

May there be many more memories.

Much love, dear Uncle.

Cheers !
